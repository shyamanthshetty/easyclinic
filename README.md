## Purpose

India is a vast country. Maintaining information of so many patients manually is very cumbersome for both public as well as private institutions. Sometimes, important information which is stored manually is lost because of unforeseen circumstances like accidental fire, natural calamity, etc. Under clinic management, patient records are digitized to make data retrieval easy and efficient. All the clinic operations starting from patient registration until billing will come under this system. Being in the digital format, patient data can be easily s accessed by multiple users simultaneously. It contains information about the pending appointment of the day, the total number of appointments done in a day and it also has a report generator that generates a report on a particular patient.


## Scope

The clinic management system has greatly impacted the lives of clinical staff as well as patients. It has removed unnecessary human errors which were common when a patient was managed manually.

This system is developed to tackle the following problems:

- Data inconsistency- It arises when data is stored manually in bulk.
- Data mix with other data- When patient data is stored manually, data mix-up is bound to happen.
- Problem regarding reporting- Earlier there were discrepancies while reporting data.
